### Project Description
SlangSwap ‚Äì A fun web app that translates slang words from one Kerala district into the slang of all other districts, complete with pronunciation and examples.
Currently, the database contains only a small set of slang words for demo purposes ‚Äî but it can be expanded in the future to include hundreds more.
You can check these database entries for testing and verification during development.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Keralites love their slang, but sometimes slang from one district sounds like alien language to another district.

##‚ú® Key Features
District-to-District Translation: Translate slang from one Kerala district to all others.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Hear the correct pronunciation of each slang word with a click.

Fun Audio Cues: Get confirmation with "Machane kitty!" on success and "Illada aliya!" on failure.

Dark Mode: A sleek dark mode for comfortable night-time slang swapping.

Simple & Fast: Built with pure, vanilla JavaScript for a lightweight and speedy experience.

Expandable JSON Database: Powered by a simple JSON file that can be easily updated with new slang.
